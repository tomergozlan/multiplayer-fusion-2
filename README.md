# Multiplayer games using Photon Fusion 2

The code is adapted from two tutorials:

* [Fusion Host Mode Tutorial](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/tutorials/host-mode-basics).
* [Fusion Shared Mode Tutorial](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/tutorials/shared-mode-basics).

IMPORTANT: Currently, I could use WebGL only with Shared mode. If you start the game on the web, please click the "Shared" button.

* WebGL builds work better on Chrome (there is probably some bug in Firefox).
